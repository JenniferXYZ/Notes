# Lecture 1

Read Chapter 1-2 \(Syntax\), 5,7,9 \(ML\)

## Some History

D.E. Knuth: The Art of Computer Programming \(TAoCP\)

* book includes math + software + English
* language for writing books
* developed TeX
  * Pascal for formatting math formulas
  * Wrote a book _The TeXBook_
  * Problem: two files to maintain
    * u have to change both the source code and the file for modification 

### **Literate Programming:**

* Only one source file needed 
* text-directed, simple translator 
* But in Pascal, you have to declare a function before using it. So he also wrote a simple Pascal translator

M.D. McIlroy \(Bell Labs\)

* pipes in sh
* hash trie \(trie: sorta binary tree but not binary\)
* shell 

```bash
tr -cs -s 'A-Za-z' '[\n]x' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

* Complement, replace space with new line, and squeeze
* sort and place duplicate into each other
* throw away duplicates; at the front of output lines, put a count
* sort numerically in reverse order

### **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis**

* Structural diversity of \(natural\) languages is essentially limitless.
  * natural language is recursive \(sometimes\)
* The language we use, to some extent, ~~determines~~ affects how we view the world, and how we think.

## Language Design Principles

### **Orthogonality**

* Every axis is independent and you can make a choice on one axis without worrying what you choose on the other axis. \(e.g. types vs object lifetimes\)
* Examples of non-orthogonality \(Counter in C\)

  **In C, functions can return values of any type EXCEPT arrays**. Because in C, arrays \*decay\* to pointers in most contexts. "return arr;" in a function returns a pointer even if ARR is an array. When working on 16-bit machine, if you return a gigantic array, it explodes. It is not orthogonal because there are some types that you cannot return in a function.

* You would rather choose a language that is orthogonal, because it does not have these edge restrictions and exception cases and it is a lot simpler. 

### Efficiency \(time/space/power/network access\)

* CPU time
* clock time
* RAM \(local storage\)
* I/O \(to flash or disk\)
* Network access \(often the biggest bottleneck\)

### Simplicity 

* easy to learn, remember and implement
* Compare \(\* \(+ 3 4\) 5\) and 3 4 + 5 \*, you need to give up something to get a simple language
* e.g. Compare i++; ++i; i+=1; i=i+1;

### Convenience

* take few steps, little time to read and write programs

### Familiarity

### Safety

* often a huge deal
* **static vs dynamic checking of programming language's rules**

```cpp
char *p = NULL;
...
*p = 'x'; //trying to dereference a null pointer
/*compile time error*/
/* In C/C++, this is an error and the implementation is not required to detect
the error; it can do whatever it wants. */
```

so better: static checking of the same thing. In Ocaml, the compiler will not allow this program \(!\). So dereferencing NULL would not happen. 

### Exception Handling \("error handling"\)

Another way to do dynamic checking-it has strengths and weaknesses

### Abstraction

How well does the language let you build abstraction layers in your program?

### Concurrency - Parallelism

### Mutability

How well does the language support changes to your program or to the language itself. Successful languages evolve. Want to make changes to the language without breaking previous code. You want to go for languages that will encourage evolving.

### Other issues:

Flexibility

Expressibility
